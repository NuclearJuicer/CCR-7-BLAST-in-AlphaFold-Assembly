No un-complexed PDB-coded structure exists (/ is available) for the increasingly-important Chemokine Receptor #7 (CCR7, Human).

The structure I applied in ChimeraX via AlphaFold was originally a BLAST of CCR7 isoform b [Homo sapiens], which I've integrated into several further structures. (07/09/2022)

As of 07/20/2022, UniProt (uniprot.org) has updated their CCR7 entry to include the DeepMind assembly that results from the AlphaFold prediction process/es I've posted here.

The DeepMind visualization platform (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) is obviously better attenuated than any other for analysis of these alignments, and I highly recommend utilizing the unique application of AlphaFold processing available on their pages.
